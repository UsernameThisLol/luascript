# LuaScript

This is my programming language project. i created as kind of a lua superset. Its not really done yet; It has some broken stuff but here's the documentation.

# Syntax
// P.s This Doc expects you know what programming languages even are and that you are familiar with these syntax from other programming languages.

The syntax is Very Javascript/C/rust based.
All of the keywords are either mine or from lua.
here is a example of the syntax.

```
// Test

fn add(x:number,y:number) {
    return x + y
}

const number: result = add(5,2)

print(result)
```

# Code
There are currently about like one command lol which is
```print()``` which is pretty self explanitory.
the rest is only syntax.

and yeah the array doesnt work.
the classes work but are partially broken

my code is f*cked up. and i hope a random 45 year old senior coder learns lua and fixes this and commits to me please help if you can. if any way. and commit it to me. or just mail me the code.

# Syntax highlighting

Yeah and if you want Syntax highlighting. use rust's highlighting.

# How to run

you need lua installed, which you can get from https://www.lua.org or for windows search luabinaries for windows. and make sure you have lua in your enviorment variables.
then change directory to root of this project and type this in the terminal
```
lua main.lua
```
this should work. and if you want to test new scripts or make one goto test/test1.luascript and edit it.

# final Message
i hope someone who is good at coding learns lua and fixes this and commits to me please help if you can. if any way. and commit it to me. or just mail me the code.
I have added as much as comments i could.
